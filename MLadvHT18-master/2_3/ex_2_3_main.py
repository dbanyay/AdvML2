    Each variable has a name (in string format), a list of categorical parameters,
    e.g. pF = [0.3, 0.2, 0.5], and a list of child nodes.

  Load the parameters of each tree and three samples from it.
  The data is stored in a dictionary. 
  
  The key indicates

      mb:= maximum branching factor of each node

  None of these numbers is important for your implementation but cab be
